# Football Kinematics Analysis

## Overview
This repository presents a cutting-edge approach to analysing and visualising the kinematic variables involved in football kicks. Leveraging Python's powerful libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and numpy, we delve deep into the biomechanical aspects of kicking, presenting detailed insights that can be pivotal for coaches, sports scientists, and performance analysts.

## Features
* Data Preprocessing: Streamlined preprocessing of raw kinematic data using pandas.
* Advanced Kinematic Analysis: Computation and analysis of thigh and shank angular velocities.
* High-Resolution Visualisation: Customisable plots for a clear, in-depth visual representation of biomechanical data.
* Performance Metrics Calculation: Automated calculation of key performance indicators like maximum angular velocities.
